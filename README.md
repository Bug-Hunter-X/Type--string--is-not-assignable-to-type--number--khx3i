# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: 'Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number''.  This occurs when you attempt an operation (like addition) on values of incompatible types.

The `bug.ts` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version using type guards or type assertions (where appropriate) to handle potential type mismatches. 

This error highlights TypeScript's strength in catching type errors during development, preventing runtime exceptions.
